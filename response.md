1. Some challenges I encountered in the lab was printing in multiples lines and the appending. I had trouble understanding of how the appending worked. I looked it up and saw that I first needed to call the appending at the end and then call the printing For the multiple line, I called sys out twice. I looked in the file it was printed out and only saw the first one. What I did then was that I made the string with one which contained new lines. Another problem was finding its length of the string. For printing, it needed the length. Originally, I hard coded the length but found out it was acrtually easier to calculate constants with the length of strings.
